# Week 4 Lab  - Connecting LLMs to Deployable Apps with HuggingFace and Gradio

### Motivation
Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized how we think about working with unstructured data, and opened up a new way to interact with digital applications. `HuggingFace`, a website that hosts hundreds of Open source LLMs of various types, is the defacto hub to access open source LLMs, we can think of it as the Github of LLMs. Like we saw with Streamlit, being able to interact with our data is a vital part to communicating results and analyses, for this, we will look at `Gradio`, another open source python library that helps us build UI interactive elements for our LLM applications.

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, we will introduce open source LLMs with the HuggingFace website, interact with them using the `transformers` library, and then look into the Gradio library to see how to build LLM applications. By the end of this class you will:
- Find different LLMs for specific use cases using the HuggingFace website.
- Download and interact with OSS LLMs and datasets using the `transformers` library.
- Build a custom LLM app using Gradio.
## Part 1 - Introduction to the HuggingFace website: Models, Data, and Spaces. 

## Part 2 - HuggingFace Transformers Library.

## Part 3 - Build LLM Apps with Gradio
