# Week 2 Lab  - Data Science and Machine Learning

### Motivation
Understanding data is one of the most critical challenges that we face in the workforce, and in research. Data management, including cleaning, analysis, and processing, is the vast majority of the time that is spent on any project. Using the right tools is vital to success. Only when the data is in the best possible state can we build the best models. And when it comes to building those models, using the right packages is also important. We will focus on Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, and PyTorch in this lab. 

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will be working with all of these tools to manage your data and build some models. By the end of this lab you will:
- Clean a dataset using best practices techniques.
- Build a simple set of machine learning models using this cleaned dataset.
- Extend to deep learning models and read through complex PyTorch models.
- Leverage Google Colab for cloud-based accelerated computing. (https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Part 1 - Setting Up Google Colab
Go to the google colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in. Then click on File --> New Notebook.
A few more basics are in the Setting_up_Colab file.

## Part 2 - Downloading Cleaning, and Processing a Dataset with Pandas
We will begin with the lego dataset, that is not a "clean" dataset, it contains missing values,and duplicate values. We will go over some examples of how to get rid of duplicate values, and how best to fill in missing values.

We will also go over a simple clustering example using the ML_Clustering_Example.



## Part 3 - Building a Linear/Random Forest Model with SciKit Learn

## Part 4 - Deep Learning with PyTorch
