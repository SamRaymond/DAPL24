# Week 2 Lab  - Data Science and Machine Learning

### Motivation
Understanding data is one of the most critical challenges that we face in the workforce, and in research. Data management, including cleaning, analysis, and processing, is the vast majority of the time that is spent on any project. Using the right tools is vital to success. Only when the data is in the best possible state can we build the best models. And when it comes to building those models, using the right packages is also important. We will focus on Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, and PyTorch in this lab. 

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will be working with all of these tools to manage your data and build some models. By the end of this lab you will:
- Clean a dataset using best practices techniques.
- Build a simple set of machine learning models using this cleaned dataset.
- Extend to deep learning models and read through complex PyTorch models.
- Leverage Google Colab for cloud-based accelerated computing. (https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Part 1 - Setting Up Google Colab
Go to the google colab website (https://colab.research.google.com/) and sign in. Then click on File --> New Notebook.
A few more basics are in the Setting_up_Colab file.

## Part 2 - Downloading Cleaning, and Processing a Dataset with Pandas
We will begin with the lego dataset, that is not a "clean" dataset, it contains missing values,and duplicate values. We will go over some examples of how to get rid of duplicate values, and how best to fill in missing values. We also use some simple machine learning tools such as the Naives Bayes Classifier to predict the values of certain variables.

We will also go over a simple clustering example using the ML_Clustering_Updated file. Where we random data generator and then cluster the data.


## Part 3 - Building a Linear/Random Forest Model with SciKit Learn
We go over an example of Random Forest, using the Simple_Random file. We access the iris dataset through scikit learn. 

## Part 4 - Deep Learning with PyTorch
We go over a basic example of neural networks where we construct a percepton, that requires user's inputs. 
Here we upload the iris dataset, and use it to build a neural network with Pytorch.
