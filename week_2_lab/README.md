# Week 2 Lab  - Data Science and Machine Learning

### Motivation
Understanding data is one of the most critical challenges that we face in the workforce, and in research. Data management, including cleaning, analysis, and processing, is the vast majority of the time that is spent on any project. Using the right tools is vital to success. Only when the data is in the best possible state can we build the best models. And when it comes to building those models, using the right packages is also important. We will focus on Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, and PyTorch in this lab. 

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will be working with all of these tools to manage your data and build some models. By the end of this lab you will:
- Clean a dataset using best practices techniques.
- Build a simple set of machine learning models using this cleaned dataset.
- Extend to deep learning models and read through complex PyTorch models.
- Leverage Google Colab for cloud-based accelerated computing. (https://colab.research.google.com/)
