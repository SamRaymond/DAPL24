# Week 1 Lab  - Introduction to the command line, GitHub, and Python. 

### Motivation
In this class, and in your careers, being comfortable with command line interfaces will ensure that you can interact with any interface, and will provide you with much more control and power of the tools we use in the digital world. Additionally, collaboration and version control are necessities for software development from solo developers, to entire teams. For this, tools like git and implementations like GitHub are pivotal in ensuring maintable and collaberative project management. Finally, while there are many excellent programming languages used in modern software engineering (C++, JavaScript, Java, etc.), Python is the definitive language for data science and machine learning.

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, you will be working with all of these tools to manage your python programming and software development. By the end of this lab you will:
- Be comfortable navigating through files and folders using the command line. 
- Write simple python files, execute them, and update them from the command line. 
- Create and manage code repositories using GitHub. 


## Part 1 - Setting Up a new repo in GitHub

## Part 2 - Navigating the terminal

## Part 3 - Creating a new python file and runnning commands from the command line
