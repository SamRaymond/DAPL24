# Week 6 Lab  - LLM Agents with LangChain

### Motivation
In this class we will look at how we can build LLM agents. These entities utilize the incredible ability of LLMs to plan and act as reasoning engines for simple and complex tasks. Using the popular library, `LangChain` you will see how we can connect our LLMs to various compuational tools so they can perform tasks like running code, searching the web, and even calling other LLMs.

### Learning Objectives
LLM agents are a new and fascinating usecase of these models. While they are still experimental, and haven't quite reached a point of production-grade quality, there is still much we can do to learn from them and test them. In this lab you will:
- Create chains with LLMs and prompts using LangChain.
- Add tools to our LLM chains so these models can do more than just write text.
- Build complex agents that can interact with data in a variety of ways.
