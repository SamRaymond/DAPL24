# Week 3 Lab  - Data Visualization and Streamlit

### Motivation
As important as it is to clean and process data, and produce the best quality models of using machine learning, without being able to present and deploy this work, the fruits of our labor go unnoticed. Modern tools make it easy to build very powerful and simply deployable applications that don't require a full-stack skillset. There are a number of these tools, and we will be focusing this week on Streamlit, a python package that is used to deploy a webserver with UI components that connect to our data and models. 

### Learning Objectives
In this lab, we will cover the importance of visually describing the data and the modeling of this data. In the lab you will:
- Build your own data visualization dashboard with Streamlit.
- Combine data exploration analysis and modeling with interactive plots and visuals
- Launch a Streamlit app using your own GitHub repo. 

## Part 1 - Introduction to Streamlit and Deploying Visualization Applications 

## Part 2 - Processing a Dataset with EDA and modeling with ML/DL

## Part 3 - Building a new Streamlit app with processed data

## Part 4 - Deploying a Streamlit app using a GitHub repo and updating using GitHub commits.
